# PKMNBN README

## FOREWORD
Long before my co-author and I published our novel series on Amazon, we wrote many fan fiction stories based on popular mangas, animes and (Japanese) video games like a Pokemon x Megaman Battle Network crossover/mashup called **P**oke**m**on **B**attle **N**etwork, or **PKMNBN**, for short. Eventually, we moved on to write and publish stories, i.e. a novel series, based on our own intelectual property; but for its 20th anniversary in 2025, I decided to pick PKMN up again and turn it into a simple but actual game for me and my co-author to play in our browsers.
