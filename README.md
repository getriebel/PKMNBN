# PKMNBN README

## Foreword
Long before my co-author and I published our novel series on Amazon, we wrote many fan fiction stories based on popular mangas, animes and (Japanese) video games like a Pokemon x Megaman Battle Network crossover/mashup called **P**oke**m**on **B**attle **N**etwork, or **PKMNBN**, for short. Eventually, we moved on to write and publish stories, i.e. a novel series, based on our own intelectual property; but for its 20th anniversary in 2025, I decided to pick PKMN up again and turn it into a simple but actual game for me and my co-author to play in our browsers.

## What is PKMN?
PKMNBN are Pokemon battles, but instead of moves you use BattleChips from the MegaMan Battle Network (MMBN) series to fight. And your Pokemon fight - and move - on a 3x6 grid! So movement and timing become king.
In addition to the amount of damage and potential effects of moves, BattleChips have attack patterns, e.g. fans of bomb BattleChips typically have depths of 3:
```
[_][_][_] [_][_][_]
[_][X][_] [_][0][_]
[_][_][_] [_][_][_]
X = Player position
0 = Bomb BattleChip damage area
```
(Note that the actual PKMN game is played on a 3x6 grid instead of MMBN's 6x3 grid as displayed above.)

## Gameplay
### Elements
BattleChips as well as NetPkmn (NetPokemon), an amalgam of Pokemon and MMBN's NetNavis, have have types or elements, a game element utilized in MMBN as well as Pokemon; although the latter features one of the more complex type/elemantal systems among JRPGs. Hence, PKMNBN relies on the elemental types from MMBN for simplification:
- 🌱 Wood: includes grass, poison and bug NetPkmn
- 💧 Aqua: includes all water and ice NetPkmn
- 🔥 Fire: includes fire NetPkmn as well as some rock (and/or ground) NetPkmns and most dragons
- ⚡ Elec: includes all electric and many steel NetPkmn
- ⚪ Norm: includes normal NetPkmn and clearly non-elemental NetPkmn (e.g. psychic, ghost, dark, fighting)

#### Sub-Elements / Types
- 💨 Air: includes non-elemental flying as well as some dragon NetPkmn
- 💗 Heal: includes fairy NetPkmn with a focus on healing
